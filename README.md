## An extension of the A* Search Algorithm in JavaScript

### Original

Original implementation by Brian Grinstead (bgrins), https://github.com/bgrins/javascript-astar.
Original demo: http://www.briangrinstead.com/files/astar/

### How to

To run this experiment, simply open the file _demo/index.html_ in your browser (JavaScript has to be enabled). 

To set the starting point of the routing, click the checkbox labelled _SetStart_, then click the field you would like to set as start field.
Clicking a field without _SetStart_ active will trigger the calculation and display of the route. 

Select _Hiddenwalls on?_ and then _Generate_ to create a playing field with the hidden walls (described in the paper) on.
